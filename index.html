           <p> THE SOLUTION:
            By highlighting the main programs, making accessible the budget, and providing a clear and prominent donation call-to-action, we will be able to increase the use of the website and ultimately increase recurrent donors. </p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>

<p>We conducted 5 interviews, one of them with the founder and CEO of the organization . 
    This helped us to get a better understanding of the problem. 
    We also were curious about what motivates people to donate, especially on a monthly basis.</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>
<p>We launched a short Google survey, we wanted to learn more about de users'
motivation and frustrations when they donate money.</p>

<h2> Interview and Survey Insights</h2>
<p>Most people are more likely to donate if they are emotionally drawn to the cause.</p>

<p> Most people like to see the budget and how the organization uses the donations.</p>
    
 <p>   Most donations for WGF come mostly from young people.</p>
    
<p>Most people research online about the organizations before donating</p>

<h2>User Persona</h2>

<p>Susan Marks is the result of all our research, and we referred to her throughout the entire project. The principal donors are millennials, we decided to focus on attracting baby boomers since based on our research they are great potential users and very likely to donate monthly.
</p>

<p>
    The research also helped us give her a personality and a short biography. We also define the core needs, the frustrations, the personality, and the demographics aspects.

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  
  <p>The WGE website was designed to inform people of WGE's work and collect donations. We have observed that the current website is not attracting donors, which is limiting the expansion of the project. How might we provide transparent and compelling information on WGE's website to increase recurrent donations.
  </p>
  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
      
We believe that providing transparent information regarding budget and projects and creating a compelling user experience on the WGE website. will achieve more frequent donations.

    <p>After performing an I like, I wish, What if, exercise-based in our research and Susan Mark, We did a feature prioritization matrix, as a result, there are four aspects to the website that Susan looks for in order to learn about the organization and decide to donate.</p>
        
    <li>Creative solutions to real problems.</li>
    <li>Stories from those who have been helped.</li>
    <li>Transparency on budget.</li>

  <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
  
  <p>The current website had an easy way to donate, but the navigation, in general, was confusing for the users. Things weren't group as expected and some titles were hard to understand or relate to.
     We did an online card sorting exercise, with the main purpose to show financial transparency and displaying an easy and clear way to donate money.
     The new navigation structure grouped better the information, and display an easy access to the budgets and financial reports. This information was already on the website, but in some early testing, we were able to discover that wasn't easy to access or to locate by the users</p>

    We created the first prototypes for testing purposes. The prototypes were useful to validate the donation process and also to test if the new site organization was showing trusty and transparent financial information.
    
    We iterate several times until we were able to achieve our main goals.

    Once we tested out the usability mistakes, we began to design the style guide.

    We worked around the green colors since they were part of their branding and the organization wanted to keep it that way. We were looking to achieve a simple and vibrant aspect, inspired by Nature and the organization's photographs. We redesign de website for desktop and mobile versions only.
